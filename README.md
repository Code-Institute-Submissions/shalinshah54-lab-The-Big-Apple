# The-Big-Apple
NYC Travel site

This is my second milestone project, Joy Travels

Being the family business for over a century we are located in the heart of Manhattan, NY providing with the best travel experience a visitor can have.  As the clinet has lived all his life in the city providing with the full knowledge and information regarding the site.

Reason of this project is to put all what I learned and understood, the concepts of HTML, CSS and JavaScript put together a fully responsive static website.

I will run you through the steps to my project and putting all the efforts behind the design along with the user experience.

Thank You for all your help for which I was able to put together my very second project

# UX - User Experience design

The inspiration and planning of the project was from different travel sites, UX sites and things that travelers love to do "enjoy the city they are in'. The website consist of travel based information about the big apple giving information about the NYC and places to see and attractions to visit. Our services provides with places to locate using a map and sites to see and pick from.

The planning of the project is broken into 5 planes;

- The Strategy Plane
- The Scope plane
- The Structure Plane
- The Skeleton Plane
- The Surface Plane

# **Strategy Plane**

The goal as a creator of my project is to act as a requirment of the travelers.

## _Creator Stories_

### _Creator Goals_ :-

- I wanted the project to b pleasing to the eyes at first glance.
- I wanted the project to be easily navigated on different platforms(mobile, tablets, laptops and desktops).
- I wanted easiy language text so the users can read without difficulties.
- I wanted to place a carousel slider to intrest the travelers to visit places just by seeing the images.
- I want all text and quotesto be properly placed and the shouldn't feel out of place as soon as they land on the page.

## _User Stories_

### _First Time Visitors_ :-

- As per the visitors, I want there experience to be user friendly.
- I want them to be easily navigate through the pages using the navigation bar.
- I want the user to navigate back to home page at anytime. 
- Being this somewhat a scroll down webpage with a link to contact page.
- I want the user experience to be same on all devices.
- I want to user to read the text without feeling bored.
- I want to images, text, therapy quotes and page presentation to be reinforcing to come back to the site.
- I want the visitor to contact the creator through the social links and contact page.
- I want them to give contact page for leaving information so we contact them with better deals and offer and come to visit us again.

### _Returning visitor goals_ :-

- As a returning visitor, I want to be able to get in contact with the creator or creators in some way, social links, or contact page using there email and message box to send it to the travel company for better deals, offers and new letters.
- As a returning visitor, I want to be able to cite the information or find out where the source of the information came from.

From my user stories, I am better able to come up with a conceptual idea of what the project needs in terms of features have more priority.
During my initial planning for the project, to make the project regarding a Travel Site I had to understand the travelers who come daily to the city, and setting up the travel place in the heart of manhattan and give the travelers best view of the city. So I decided to research and ask question to the travel agent for the locations, sites to visit. The City sites provide well informative script and gave a better ideas and helped me put all this together I was able to better understand the needs of this project.
I also would liked to know what travels are looking for and which places they are intrested to see most:

- How do you like to see the City.
- How would like to see the City.
- Do you know about different neigborhoods and places to see there.
- Do you like to recieve news letters via emails.
- If for any reason they need to contact where they can leave a msg.

# **Scope Plane**

To Make the user experience more pleasing; In order to do so I started looking around asking questions to travel agents and going through the city websites, asking questions to the travelers personally with a site in place. After putting together all there ideas and researching I was able to put together a site which users would like to visit.

From the feedback of the users I came to know that they are more that the visitors love to see in short amount of time.

So I started planning using phases

#### _Phase - 1_

- A home page with a scroll down option. 
- Attractions which has a carousel slider with the places to see in the city.(Using JS)
- Plan section which has a Map of the New York City and the 4 boroghs with cluster Markers to     pin point the places. (using JS)
- A link on the main heading taking you to neighborhood page.
- Contact Us page (Email Sending by JS)

#### _Phase - 2_

- Section for direction using public transportation.(Using google API)
- Picking individual places to visit with a package and getting a quote on them.
- Weather on the page that gives travelers idea. (API)

#### _Phase - 3_

- Fully functional site (JavaScript knowledge)
- Web domine with a customer URL

Having a phased approach to the project allows users to feel surprised when a new version is deployed with extra elements and allows me time to collect feedback and better understand flaws with my initial design or development and to help me grow. Also allows me to implement new skills I have learned and build upon the initial design.

# **Structure Plane**

The first step for my research was visiting sites and knowing different layouts, elements in navigation bar, images, quotes, text, and colors.

### _Colors_ :

- Black
- Grey
- Shade of Orange
- White

Dark grey background to start with to make the images and text stand out more by giving the page the depth and drawing attention.

### _Typography_ :

- Reem Kufi
- Roboto

I used Roboto script throughout all the pages which looks simple  and also easy for anybody to read the text.

I also used Reem Kufi script in the heading of the information is provided to have the heading.

Navigation bar is fixed to the top as the page moves up and down where you can use the navigation bar anytime without having to scroll back up. The navigation bar changes to toggler with an toggler icon at 831px, which means any devices. It has an animation for the navlinks to appear with a delay using javascript and the burger symbol changes to an close symbol which works functionally.

Social Media links in the footer with a simple background color when hover over it will help user with attractive eye catching icons which upon clicking will direct them to the blank page regarding there individual sites.

Hero Image which is aligned vertically in the desktop view and horizontally in the laptop, tablet and mobile view. The images are well pixelated and properly arranged to give the page an attractive interaction with a good visual effect. On the home page at the attraction section there is a carousel slider with 5 images which slides upon loading the page every 2s interval. Other image on neighborhood page indicating the 5 boroghs with different images. 

There is a plan section which has a google map showing the place to see in and around the city with Cluster Markers.

The text is consistant throughout all the pages mostly consisting information about travel.
