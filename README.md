# The-Big-Apple
NYC Travel site

This is my second milestone project, Joy Travels

Being the family business for over a century we are located in the heart of Manhattan, NY providing with the best travel experience a visitor can have.  As the clinet has lived all his life in the city providing with the full knowledge and information regarding the site.

Reason of this project is to put all what I learned and understood, the concepts of HTML, CSS and JavaScript put together a fully responsive static website.

I will run you through the steps to my project and putting all the efforts behind the design along with the user experience.

Thank You for all your help for which I was able to put together my very second project
[The Big Apple]()

# UX - User Experience design

The inspiration and planning of the project was from different travel sites, UX sites and things that travelers love to do "enjoy the city they are in'. The website consist of travel based information about the big apple giving information about the NYC and places to see and attractions to visit. Our services provides with places to locate using a map and sites to see and pick from.

The planning of the project is broken into 5 planes;

- The Strategy Plane
