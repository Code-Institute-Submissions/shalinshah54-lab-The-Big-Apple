- I want them to be easily navigate through the pages using the navigation bar.
- I want the user to navigate back to home page at anytime by clicking on the logo or the home navlink.
- Being this somewhat a scroll down webpage with a link to neighborhood and  contact page.
- As the user scrolls down they will come across the carosel with a slider and can manually operate it.
- Further scrolling down there is a Map area which is generated by the google map api and using the icon customizer to place then in the map for better view of attraction, train station, parks and sports places, etc.
- I want the user experience to be same on all devices.
- I want to user to read the text without feeling bored.

- On the neighborhood page there is a simple information about the areas to see and history about the neighborhood.
- I want the visitor to contact the creator through the social links and contact page.
- I want them to give contact page for leaving information so admin can contact them with better deals and offer and come to visit us again.

### Returning visitor goals

- As a returning visitor, I want to be able to get in contact with the creator or creators in some way, social links, or contact page using there email and message box to send it to the travel company for better deals, offers and new letters.
- As a returning visitor, I want to be able to cite the information or find out where the source of the information came from.
- As a returning visitor, I would like to see more features like the weather on the page to know how is the weather at the place I am visiting.
- I would like to purchase tickets online and not go to the office and pick up the ticket.

## Responsiveness
This project was required to be totally responsive, and mobile friendly therefore I decided to use Bootstrap as my main framework for it's cut down components that result in a clean, uncluttered view and minimize to add custom styles. Testing was done using dev-tool during build process, and also a final test of the entire website was done using Android phone and iphone to check its responsives.
- Page was responsive overall and no major issue noticed however here was slightly issue with excess whitespace above and below footer while viewing on Android phone and specially with the card with information on the home page which collapes as the screen size changes and the carosel on the large devices the left and right buttons are places in the left and right center as the screen on medium and small devices it moves down to the bottom part of the images.
- The responsiveness of the navbar changes to a slide nav at 811px and the burger menu appears. The burger menu transforms to a close button.
- The carosel is responsive as the page loads will slide every 5s will change. And can be manually operated.
- The Map is responsive with the icon added for the users to specifically see the places.
- The contact page has a form which can be filled out by a user and send it responsively to the admin and the user can be contacted back.


### Navbar

- The navbar is located on the top of all pages which contains three links, which are Home, Neighborhood and Contact Us.
- All the links are working properly  across all the pages.
- There is a logo of Joy Travels which is a direct link to the home page from any other pages.
- At 811px the navbar changes to a sidenav which is fully functional from the right side. There is a burger menu which appears on the top right corner. 
- The burger menu on click will open the sidenav which will slide in from the right covering the whole page.
- Once the sidenav opens the navlinks have an animation of transition which slowly comes in. Using JavaScript the links can be added and removed without changing the functionallity of navbar.
- On clicking on the burger menu when the sidenav opens the menu will tranform to a close button. And on clicking on the close button it will transform back to burger menu.

## Home page

- The home page is a scroll down page which can be easily accessed.
- The first section contain a hero image of the NYC with a darker background. 
- Over the hero image there is a card which gives a little content about the city and a plan button. On clicking on the plan button it will scroll down to the attraction page where the visitor can decide which place to visit in NY.
- The card with the content collapses as it changes the page size 
![image-card](assets/images/card-error.jpg)
- This was debugged by changing the CSS `.card-body` which was used across all the media query at
     - 1400px
     - 970px
     - 831px
     - 765px
     - 650px
     - 517px
     - 450px
     - 380px

     this is fixed making few changes to the CSS property.

#### Attraction Section

- Once the page loads the carosel starts the slider which works using bootstrap JS and has 5s delay. There are manual buttons to move the carosel. ![image-card](assets/images/carosel-button.jpg)
- There is a left and right arrow button and there is a dot under the image which provides the vistitor to directly guide them to the perticular image.
- Issue is on larger screen the buttons appear on the image. But as the screen size changes the buttons collapse down in the lower part of the carosel.

#### Plan Section
- On the home page under the attraction there is plan section which displays the map which was taken using google api which is credentialed and functioning properly.
- There are icon of a flag which shows the location for all the attractions in NYC and the other boros. On hovering over the icon it will display the name of that location.
- The user can zoom in and see the places closely where its located. 
- Before I had issues where there was only icons displaying and not the names.

- After fixing the bug 
![map](assets/images/map-img2.jpg)

### Footer Section
- In the footer section there are social media links which are links to the personal account. 
- All the links have a hover effect which pops out with an animation and there color changes.
- Below that is a copy rights trade mark.
- This section is carried across all the pages.

### Neighborhood Page

- This page can be accessed by clicking on the nav link of neighborhood and take you to the page.
- This is a very simple page which contains images from all the boros and a brief information about the different boros.
- As the screen size is reduces there is alot of white space remaining before the footer section.


### Contact Page

- Contact page can be acessed by clicking on the contact us in the nav links. Once the page loads there is simple feedback form which is linked to email that can be send to the admin.
- This email function is generated by the [email.js](https://www.emailjs.com/).
- This is linked to the connected to the developers email id but in fucture can be connected to the admins email.
- Using emailjs the email formate can be customized as the admins likes and requirements. 
- The form contains required filled. which are full name, email and message.
- Once the user filled the form and submits it the admin recieves the email.
- Issue with this is I am not able to see the email being send on the page but in my inbox and the emailjs shows the email being send successfully.

- The form being a required field tells the user if the field is empty to fill it up.
